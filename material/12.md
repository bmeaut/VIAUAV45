# Chapter 12: App architecture

In the previous chapters, we've seen a lot of aspects of app development in Flutter. It's time to take a look at one of the many ways to assemble and app with maintainability, extendibility, and testability in mind.

The project we'll be working with is a list-detail app called [NY Times Most Popular](../projects/chapters/chapter_12/ny_times_most_popular), which has a near production-ready architecture.

## Unidirectional architectures, data flow

Architectures that update the presentation (UI) layer of the app by providing state that is transformed by received UI events are called *unidirectional architectures*.

"Unidirectional", because data (events, state, and data to update the state) flows in one direction only, resulting in the UI being always in sync with the current state.

> We already learned in [chapter 6](05.md) that state handling is fundamental when working with Flutter. Actually, the BLoC pattern itself is a fair representation of a unidirectional data flow architecture.

## App architecture overview

> Attention! This architecture is just one of the many we can implement and work with. There are many other concepts to look out for, like [MobX](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx) and [Redux](https://pub.dev/packages/redux), which were adapted from the JavaScript world.

Layering our app's architecture opens up a world of possibilities and benefits. Each layer has their own responsibilities, and they can be modified without significantly touching the others (at least in theory).

Let's go through each layer's responsibilities:

- **UI**: This is where UI widgets, or more precisely, screens are. They observe immutable state provided by the state handling implementation (e.g.: Provider, Cubit, Bloc, etc.). They also notify the state handlers about input events.
- **UI state handling**: Components related to state management (implemented with Provider, Cubit, Bloc, etc.).They receive events from the UI, call the Interactors when business logic needs to be involved, and update/emit state to the UI accordingly.
- **Interactors**: They contain the business logic of the application. They aggregate and manipulate data received from data sources and perform computations. They aren't tied to screens, but the domains and the functionality of the app's features. They operate on canonical, *domain* models of the data of the app.
- **Data sources**: Provides the interactors with data from various sources. Sources can be anything, like local databases, a network APIs, key-value stores, system APIs, etc. Data sources are responsible for abstracting away the concrete implementation of saving and retrieving data, and keeping the stored data in a consistent state. Data sources are also responsible for converting between their respective data representations to a canonical, domain layer representation.

## Wiring things up - DI frameworks and service locators

 Maintaining the dependencies of each component is a fundamental thing to take into consideration while developing apps.

The main principle to keep in mind here is [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).
