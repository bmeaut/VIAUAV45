# Accessibility and responsive UI support on Flutter

In the previous chapters we've learnt how should we implement a Flutter application for ourself, for our devices in our prefered language. We have only one problem with that: 
Luckily not only we will use it. Others will use it as well if we support accessibility. 

## Accessibility
TODO

### Internationalization and localization
If the app might be deployed to users who speak another language then we have to internationalise it. That means we develop the app in a way that makes it possible to localise values like text and layouts for each language that the app supports.
TODO

- `a11y`
- `i18n`
- `l10n`

[intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package

## Responsive UI
TODO
### SizedBox vs. FittedBox
TODO
### Wrap
TODO
### Layoutbuilder vs. MediaQuery
The main difference with the MediaQuery always provides the size of the full application, info about the physical screen. While layoutbuilder actually takes only the current parent size.

TODO sample: Wrap the MediaQuery into a sizeconfig like the [flutter_screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) package and use it.
